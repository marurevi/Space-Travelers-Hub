# React & Redux group project - Space Travelers' Hub

> We worked with the real live data from the SpaceX API. We built a web application for a company that provides commercial and scientific space travel services. The application allows users to book rockets and join selected space missions.

> ### The Space Travelers' Hub
> The Space Travelers' Hub consists of Rockets, Missions, and the My Profile section.

> - Rockets
> The Rockets section displays a list of all available SpaceX rockets. Users can book each rocket by clicking the reservation button or cancel the previously made booking. 

> - Missions
> The Missions section displays a list of current missions along with their brief description and participation status. There is also a button next to each mission that allows users to join the selected mission or leave the mission the user joined earlier.

> - My Profile
> The My Profile section displays all reserved rockets and space missions.
